Sample application demonstrating how to use Spring REST Docs with JUnit 5.

`BeerControllerTest` calls to a simple service and produces documentation snippets for the service.

The different documented operations that this service provides through the "/api/v1/beer" endpoint are the following:

== Operation to get existing beers by ID

You can get an existing beer by making an HTTP GET request to the "yourdomainhere:8080/api/v1/beer/beerId" endpoint
and replacing beerId for the id of the beer you need to get.

=== Request accepted path parameters

include::{snippets}/v1/beer-get/path-parameters.adoc[]

=== Response fields for each request
