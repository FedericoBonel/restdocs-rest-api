Sample application demonstrating how to use Spring REST Docs with JUnit 5.

`BeerOrderControllerTest` calls to a simple service and produces three documentation snippets.

One showing how to make an HTTP request to the service using cURL:

include::{snippets}/orders/curl-request.adoc[]

One showing the HTTP request itself:

include::{snippets}/orders/http-request.adoc[]

And one showing the HTTP response:

include::{snippets}/orders/http-response.adoc[]

Response body:
include::{snippets}/orders/response-body.adoc[]

Response fields:
